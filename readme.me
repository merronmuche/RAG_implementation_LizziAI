##Lizzy AI aims to create an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 
chatbot using Hybrid Large Language Model (LLM) technology. The ultimate goal 
is to develop a fully autonomous contract bot capable of independently handling 
tasks such as drafting, reviewing, and negotiating contracts. The project’s primary 
objective revolves around constructing, evaluating, and enhancing a RAG system 
specifically designed for Contract Q&A—interacting with contracts and answering 
questions related to them.
